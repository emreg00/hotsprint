# Hot Spots of Protein Interfaces (HotSprint) database web interface

The "vintage" PHP implemenation of Computational Hot Spots of Protein Interfaces database. Used to be located at prism.koc.edu.tr/hotsprint, before got substituted by [Hotregion](prism.koc.edu.tr/hotregion)

HotSprint gives information about the evolutionary history of the residues on the interface and represents which residues are highly conserved on the interface. In this way, functionally and structurally important residues on the interface can be distinguished.
